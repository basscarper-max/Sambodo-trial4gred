        <p>
            Project DraftED is an advocacy that aims to guide first-year Civil Engineering students
            in learning both the basic and advanced tools of AutoCAD. Through workshops and mentorship
            from upper-year students, the project helps juniors build a strong foundation in digital
            drafting and design.
